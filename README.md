## About you!

Give a quick Intro!

- Whats your name?
- Whats your background?
- Why are you interested in JavaScript?

## What is javaScript?

### A very brief history

Created by Brendan Eich in 1995 in ONLY 10 days during his time at Netscape Communications.

A lot of updates have happened of course since then, but its still fun to see some of the [quirks](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) still in the language!

Read more about the history of JavaScript [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).

Javascript is often used with HTML and CSS to create dynamic web pages. 

### Who uses javaScrip?

Almost everyone!

- Large Companies (Google, Facebook)
- Startups
- Agencies
- Pretty much anyone using web technology

It's one of the safest languages to learn for getting a job!


### What can you do with JavaScript

- Web Development
	- Front-End
	- Back-End
- Mobile Development 
- [Machine learning](https://js.tensorflow.org/) 😱
- [Embedded(Hardware) Programming](http://ejs.co/) 😲

#### Popular Frameworks to keep in mind

When learning more about JS you'll probably keep learning about these!

- Node
- Express
- React
- Angular
- Vue

We're doing a [React workshop next week](https://www.meetup.com/Learn-Code-Seattle/events/260067513/)!


## JavaScript Basics:

## Comments
You'll see comments throughout code. In Javascript they are made with `//`. They are a great way of explaining what your code is doing. So when you come back to it months later it won't be as confusing. Or when a new team member works on your code base

```
// I am a comment. I do not change any output
```

```
/*
I am 
a
multi
line 
comment
*/
```

## Print output

In programming its tradition to start with printing the output of "Hello, World!". You do this in JavaScript with the `console.log()` function!

print Hello, World!

`console.log("Hello, World!")`

## Variables:
Variable are a way to store information.
This is super useful! You can then receive or update the variable in your program. You'll see this later!

Think of it as naming a piece of data.

We're going to define our variable using the keyword `var`. 

```
var twitter = "@sagecodes";
var score = 0;

console.log(twitter)

```

### Declaring Variables

In newer versions of JavaScript you may see `let` or `const` used instead of `var`.

- `Const` is used to declare variables you do not want to change later in your code. 

- `let` is similar to `var`, but has a newer featured called block scoping and perhaps more importantly prevents name collision.

### Examples:

using `var`

```
var globalvar = 'hello'

// CAN declare new variable with existing name (it overwrites)
var globalvar = 'by'

// CAN assign new value to variable
globalvar = 'new value'

```

using `let`

```
let globalvar = 'hello'

// CANNOT declare new variable with existing name
let globalvar = 'by'

// CAN assign new value to variable
globalvar = 'by'
``` 

using `const`

```
const globalvar = 'hello'

// CANNOT declare new variable with existing name
const globalvar = 'by'

// CANNOT assign new value to variable
globalvar = 'by'
``` 

Essentially `let` and `const` are considered "safer" to use.


We're going to use `var` for the rest of the workshop today and we won't dive deeper into the differences today, but you can read more about `let` & `const` [here](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/javascript-es6-var-let-or-const-ba58b8dcde75). 


## Interact with dialog boxes
Using dialog boxes can be simple way to get started interacting with users.

**Note**: These don't work in repl, but we can use them in our own files or in our developer console. I'll show you how to do this!

Alert: Pop up information in a dialog box

`alert("Hello, I'm a pop up");`
 
Prompt: get information from a user in dialog box

`prompt("I'm a pop up you can type in!");`

### Challenge: Get a users name

Use the `prompt()` function above to ask a user for a name, save it in a variable called `name` and print the variable using `console.log()`

You will have to use your developer console for this one!


## Data Types:
We're going to stick with the basics, so We wont be going over EVERY data type in javascript, but you you can read a more comprehensive list [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures).  

Feel free to try these code samples out in your [repl](https://repl.it/)!

### Numbers:

Numbers are written just like you would think. Just the number! No quotes or symbols to worry about. If you do put quotes around a number it will become a string (see next)

`25` `100`

Multiple, Add, Divide, Compare

- `5 * 5` | output: 25
- `5 + 5` | output: 10
- `8 / 2` | output: 4
- `8 > 2` | output: true

### Strings:
Strings can be a collection of letters, symbols and/or numbers. They are made by surrounding the content with quotation marks.

`"Hello, World."`
`"CrAzy Random String 987879896jvdjvda &&(&(@*(*"`

Can we add strings together? Try it out!

#### Print strings with variable in them:

Concatenation

```
var name = "Alexa"
var age = 40
var career = "programmer"

var s = "My name is " + name + ". I am " + age + " years old. I am a " + career + "." ;

console.log(s)

```

A newer ES6 way! 
This is much cleaner and easier to edit later.

**note** The string containing the variable using back-ticks |  ` | not single quotes. 

```
var name = "Alexa"
var age = 40
var career = "programmer"

var s = `My name is ${name}. I am ${age} years old. I am a ${career}. `;

console.log(s);

```

### Booleans:
You can think of Booleans as yes(true) and no(false)

`true` `false`

We'll go into how to use these in a little bit. For now just remember they exist!

### Arrays (lists):

Often used to store a list of values.

#### Create array

```
var tvshows = ['West World','Mr. Robot', 'Game of Thrones'];
console.log(tvshows);
```

#### Access Items in Array

```
var tvshows = ['West World','Mr. Robot', 'Game of Thrones'];

// print the first item in array;
console.log(tvshows[0]);
```

#### Update Items in Array

```
var tvshows = ['West World','Mr. Robot', 'Game of Thrones']

console.log(tvshows[0]);

// Assign new value to first item of array
tvshows[0] = "Robots in the west";

// print the first item in array
console.log(tvshows[0]);
```

#### Adding Items in Array

```
var tvshows = ['West World','Mr. Robot', 'Game of Thrones']

console.log(tvshows);

// add new value to first item of array
tvshows.push("Firefly");

// print the first item in array
console.log(tvshows);
```

#### Removing Items from Array


```

var tvshows = ['West World','Mr. Robot', 'Game of Thrones', "Firefly"]

console.log(tvshows);

// remove last item with pop
tvshows.pop();
console.log(tvshows);

// Target item to remove
tvshows.splice(0, 2)


// print the first item in array
console.log(tvshows);

```

### Objects (Dictionaries):

#### Create Object

`person =	{ "name": "Bob", "age": 50, "occupation": 'programmer' }`

```
var person =	{
  "name": "Alexa",
  "age": 40,
  "occupation": 'programmer'
};

```

#### Access Items in an Object


```
var person =	{
  "name": "Alexa",
  "age": 40,
  "occupation": 'programmer'
};


console.log(person);

// two ways of accessing items
console.log(person.name);
console.log(person['age']);

// example using object inside a string senence. 
var s = `My name is ${person.name}. I am ${person["age"]} years old. I am a ${person.occupation}. `;

console.log(s);

```

#### Update Items in Object


```
var person =	{
  "name": "Alexa",
  "age": 40,
  "occupation": 'programmer'
};


console.log(person);

// Select element and assign new variable
person.name = "Bob";

console.log(person);

```

#### Adding Items in Object

```
var person =	{
  "name": "Alexa",
  "age": 40,
  "occupation": 'programmer'
};


console.log(person);

// or person['newkey']
person.newkey = "Im a new item";

console.log(person);

```

#### Removing Items from Object

```

var person =	{
  "name": "Alexa",
  "age": 40,
  "occupation": 'programmer',
  "newkey": "Im a new item"
};


console.log(person);

// use delete
delete person.newkey

console.log(person);

```


### Access Object value in Array 

```
var person =	{
  "name": "Alexa",
  "age": 40,
  "occupation": 'programmer',
  "newkey": "Im a new item"
};

// Add object to list
var listy = [3, "hello", person]

console.log(listy)

// Access a object item from object in array
console.log(listy[2].name)

// Access a object item from object in array
console.log(listy[2]["age"])

```

### Access Array item in Object

```
var favfoods = ["apples", "mac & cheese", "chcolate"]

var person =	{
  "name": "Alexa",
  "age": 40,
  "occupation": 'programmer',
  "favs": favfoods
};


// Access a object item from object in array
console.log(person.favs[0])

// Access a object item from object in array
console.log(person.favs[1])

```




## Comparison Operators:
Comparison Operators are used quite frequently in programming. Its a great way to compare and use data.

Again we won't cover ALL of the comparison operators in this workshop, but you can see a full list of them [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators)

- `==` Equal
- `===` Strict Equal
- `!=` Not Equal
- `>` Greater Than
- `>=` Greater Than or Equal
- `<` Less Than
- `<=` Less Than or Equal

Example use:

`current_score >= highest_score`
This would return a boolean value. Depending on the values of these variables this would return either `true` or `false`. Try it in your console using numbers instead of variables!

`===` Strict Equal vs `==` Equal?



## Conditionals

When writing a program you'll often want to check if data meets a certain condition or not. We can use conditionals to make decision about our data and create different outcomes

 In javascript you'll often use the `if` statement. This may be followed by `else if` or `else` depending on how many conditions need to be checked.

Example:

```
if (guess == answer) {
    message = "You Win!";
} else if (guess < answer) {
    message = "Your guess is too low!";
} else if (guess > answer){
    message = "your guess is too high!";
} else {
	message = "I think you entered something wrong...";
}
```

### Challenge: Dynamic output

Use conditionals to compare two variable and change its output depending on the variables. 


## Loops
We're going to go over some of the basic loops in javascript, but yet again we're not going to cover everything, so you may want to read more about loops [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration).

Loops are used when you want to repeat something. You can repeat the exact same thing, or change some variable and repeat the action again.

two common types of loops are `for` and `while`.
`for` loops are often used to run a loop a specified amount of time.

`while` loops are often used to run a loop indefinitely until certain criteria are met.

Example:

This `for` loop will run 5 times, and print out the value of `i` to the console. 

```
var i;
for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i)
}
```

If `i` were set to 1 it would run this loop and print the string until the value of `i` changed. If you run this in your browser it will probably crash it!

```
var i = 0;
while (i == 1) {
    console.log("I will crash your browser")
}
```

## Challenge: FizzBuzz

## Functions
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle

Functions make it easy to reuse code. If you find yourself repeating code you may want to turn it into a function!

Example:
This function takes in two arguments(a, b) and returns the value of them added together. 

```
function add(a, b) {
	return a + b; 
};
```
to use the function call it by writing its name and open/close parenthesis(). With arguments passed inside the parenthesis():

- `add(5,5)` | output: 10
- `add(2,5)` | output: 7

In this simple example you're not saving a ton of code, but imagine a function that uses many lines of code! 

### Challenge: Make your fizzBuzz function

Make our FizzBuzz Solution a function.

Allow that function to take in a number and run fizzbuzz on it.



## Lets do some code!
You just learned a lot! Lets put it together and build something!

Sign up if you haven't already and create a new project: https://repl.it/


We're going to build a number guessing game using:

- variables
- Comparison Operators
- Conditionals
- loops
- functions
- dialog boxes

If you get stuck or want to look ahead at the completed project you can view it [here](https://repl.it/@SageElliott/GuessingGame).

What are some ideas for improvements? 

- Exit on command
- data validation
- input the number range from popup
- output grammar depending on number of tries
