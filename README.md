# Learn to Code: Introduction to JavaScript

Brought to you by Galvanize. Learn more about the way we teach code at [galvanize.com](http://galvanize.com).

## Overview
The goal of this brief course is to provide you with a fun introduction to the world of web development with Javascript.

#### Here's what we'll be doing:
* Overview of basic JavaScript concepts
* Building a simple application using javscript
* Playing around in the sandbox

#### Before you begin, a quick gut check:
* This course is for absolute beginners
* Feel free to move ahead
* Help others when you can
* Be patient and nice
* You will get through it!

#### What is programming?
Programming is giving your computer a set of instructions to perform a task. 

## Setting up your computer
(Brace yourself...)

#### Please set up the following:
* A web browser to see what we're working on as others see it (Recommend Google Chrome: [chrome.google.com] (http://chrome.google.com))
* We will be using an online text editor for this workshop. You can sign up here: [https://repl.it/](https://repl.it/)


## Javscript Basics:

### Data Types:
We're going to stick with the basics, so We wont be going over EVERY data type in javascript, but you you can read a more comprehensive list [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures).  

Feel free to try these code samples out in your developer console!

#### Numbers:

Numbers are written just like you would think. Just the number! No quotes or symbols to worry about.

`25` `100`

Multiple, Add, Divide, Compare

- `5 * 5` | output: 25
- `5 + 5` | output: 10
- `8 / 2` | output: 4
- `8 > 2` | output: true

#### Strings:
Strings can be a collection of letters, symbols and/or numbers. They are made by surrounding the content with quotation marks.

`"Hello, World."`
`"CrAzy Random String 987879896jvdjvda &&(&(@*(*"`

#### Booleans:
You can think of Booleans as yes(true) and no(false)

`true` `false`

We'll go into how to use these in a little bit. For nowjust remember they exsist!


## Variables:
Variable are a way to store information.
This is super useful! You can then recieve or update the variable in your program. You'll see this later!

- `var twitter = "@sagecodes";`
- `var score = 0;`


## Comparison Oporators:
Comparison Oporators are used quite frequently in programming. Its a great way to compare data.

Again we won't cover ALL of the comparison oporators in this workshop, but you can see a full list of them [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators)

- `==` Equal
- `!=` Not Equal
- `>` Greater Than
- `>=` Greater Than or Equal
- `<` Less Than
- `<=` Less Than or Equal

Example:

`current_score >= highest_score`
This would return a boolean value. Depending on the values of these variables this would return either `true` or `false`. Try it in your console using numbers instead of variables!


## Functions
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle

Functions make it easy to reuse code. If you find yourself repeating code you may want to turn it into a function!

Example:
This fucntion takes in two arguments(a, b) and returns the value of them added together. 

```
function add(a, b) {
	return a + b; 
};
```
to use the function call it by writting its name and open/close parentheis(). With arguments passed inside the parentheis():

- `add(5,5)` | output: 10
- `add(2,5)` | output: 7

In this simple example you're not saving a ton of code, but imagine a function that uses many lines of code! 


## Conditionals


## Loops

## Intereact with dialog boxes
Alert: Pop up information in a dialog box

`alert();`
 
Prompt: get information from a user in dialog box

`prompt()`


## Lets do some code!
You just learned a lot! Lets put it together and build something!
